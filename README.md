# SIIM-Pneumothorax-Segmentation
Developed a model(Top 10% rank on Kaggle LB) that is able to segment/detect regions of Pneumothorax from chest X-rays it can help doctors with the diagnosis. if successful, could aid in the early recognition of pneumothoraces and save lives.


### Dataset source:
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/overview

## Business Contrains
* The cost of misclassification can be high. We do not want a Pneumothorax person to be detected as normal.
* No strict latency constrain.
